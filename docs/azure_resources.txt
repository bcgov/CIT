# Azure resources in production and their usage:
acraf6z1jmd - The Container Registry.  This is the place the docker files that GitHub Actions creates. Generally this will hold the containers used for CIT-API and CIT-WEB

api-cit3-citz-bcgov-prod - This is the "App Service" which is the an implementation of the docker image for API backend.
api-cit3-citz-bcgov-test

citapi (acraf6z1jmd/citapi) - The webhook used to reference the Container Registry.
citapiprod (acraf6z1jmd/citapiprod)

clnpdictprbi01 - This is the Power BI Embedded resource used as a connector for PowerBI Cloud

psql-cit3-citz-bcgov-prod - the prod and following test PSQL databases actively used.
psql-cit3-citz-bcgov

tfstatecit - Storage to hold the Terraform state files.  These are important and should be preserved.

web-cit3-citz-bcgov-prod - this is the web service actively used for the frontend.
web-cit3-citz-bcgov


# Resources no longer needed or unknown
cit-data-pipeline         - This is an obsolete container instance and should be removed once the GitHub Action Data pipeline has been validated to work as expected.
cit-data-pipeline-prod

cit-dev-lab-vnet          - the Virtual Network associated with the lab VMs - likely unneeded.
cit-dev1 (cit-devtest-lab1/cit-dev1) - The lab virtual machine.  Likely unused/no longer needed
cit-devtest-lab1

cit-email-notifications     - A logic App - seems to have been used for email service.  not sure it's used any longer. Needs to be verified.
cit-email-notifications-prod

cit-email-reminders - Container instances for sending emails.  I think this was replaced with the Common Hosted Email Service (CHES)
cit-email-reminders-prod

cit-idir-tracking-prod - Containers and VMs used for tracking IDIR. Again, I think this has been obsoleted but needs to be verified.
cit-idir-tracking

citdevtestlab19876 - Key Vault - unused - comes be default with the Resource Group

citpipelinedata - Storage for data files. This should have been obsoleted in Phase4 of the project.  It's unclear if this data (and hence storage) is still required.

citshell - log storage for instances.  Expected it's no longer needed.
citshel2

Dtlcit-devtest-lab1 - obsolete network for the lab

key-cit3-citz-bcgov-test - no longer needed - never fully implemented

cit-cit3-citz-bcgov-prod - This appears to be an obsolete app service no longer used.
