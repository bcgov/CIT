        <h4>Northern Rockies</h4>
        <p>
          The Northern Rockies Regional Municipality is included in our data as
          a "Regional District," even though it is technically a regional
          municipality, and not a regional district. The shape of this "regional
          district" was imported from the

            >Census Divisions</a

          dataset from the BC Data Catalogue.

        <h4>Distance Calculations</h4>
        <p>
          We calculated driving distances and driving times using the
          <a href="https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/bc-route-planner"
            >BC Route Planner API</a
          >. We only calculate driving distances where the birds' eye distance
          is within 50 km between location assets and communities, OR the
          distances between the nearest location asset of each type for a
          community if none are within 50 km.

        <h4>Search Filters Distances</h4>
        <p>
          The search filters for local assets on the Explore page use driving
          distance or driving time (based on road information) when available.
          This means that some local assets might be excluded from the search
          results when searching by driving time, even if they "should" be
          within the selected range. This could happen if a local asset and a
          community are separated by a body of water (i.e. there are no
          connecting roads between them). However, when filtering by driving
          distance, the search will fall back to birds' eye (straight line)
          distances whenever driving distances are unavailable.

        <h4>Census Subdivisions</h4>
        <p>
          Demographic data is sourced from Stats Canada at the subdivision
          level. This means that data from unincorporated communities may
          actually apply to surrounding area containing several other small
          communities.

          >
            <p>
              The percentage of average number of dwellings needing repairs is
              calculated using the "Total - Private households by household size
              - 100% data" (2.1.2) field as the total.

        <h4>Transport Status (High Capacity Transport Services)</h4>
        <p>
          The distance filter for facilities uses driving distance based on road
          information when available, and falls back to birds' eye (straight
          line) distance otherwise. (For example, if a facility and a community
          are separated by a body of water, driving distance will not be
          available.)

        <p>
          We import census data from the
          <a
            href="https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E"
            >Statistics Canada 2016 Census Profile</a
          >. Communities whose corresponding Census Subdivisions are missing
          more than 25% of the census fields that we use are flagged as having
          incomplete census data. The charts in the reports are calculated based
          on available data and some charts may be blank or may not represent
          all communities (if viewing aggregate reports in the Explore page). If
          all communities in the selection are missing over 25% of their census
          fields (or on the community detail page), some reports are hidden due
          to insufficient data.
