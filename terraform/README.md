# Terraform

This project uses Terraform in order to provision the necessary cloud infrastructure for deploying
the application. The current chosen infrastructure provider is Microsoft Azure. In order to deploy
the application you will need to have an available Azure subscription in which to deploy to. 

## Prerequisites
* Terraform CLI 
* Azure CLI installed

# Configure Azure CLI
We first need to setup a Azure service principal (account) to allow Terraform Cloud to manage the
Azure resources and the Terraform .tfstate file.

Detailed instructions
[here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/service_principal_client_secret.html#configuring-the-service-principal-in-terraform):

Basically do this: `az login` `az account list` If there's several subscriptions then you may need
to specify which subscription you wish to use. `az account set --subscription="SUBSCRIPTION_ID"`

Finally, copy the `variables.auto.tfvars.template` file and rename it `variables.auto.tfvars`, then
populate the following variables:

* **subscription_id**={Your Azure subscription ID} 
* **tenant_id**={tenant}

## Configure Github Repository
Terraform includes a provider which allows us to automatically provision Github Action build secrets
as part of the provisioning process. In order to do this we need a PAT token with repository access.

For a user that has full admin permissions on your Github repository, create a PAT token with the
following permissions.

Then populate the `variables.auto.tfvars` with the PAT:
* **github_token**= PAT token
* **github_repository**= Github project repository name
* **github_owner**= Github repository owner (group)

## Configure Github Actions

Enable the github action for publishing the API and webapp to Azure Container Registry (ACR) by
renaming the `acr-publish.yml.disabled` file in `.github/workflows` folder to `acr-publish.yml`.

NOTE: This action will fail until you have provisioned the ACR as part of the Terraform provisioning
process.

## Setting up remote backend

```
az storage account create --resource-group CLNPD1-ZCACN-RGP-CITZ-ICT-Cit01 --name tfstatecit  --sku Standard_LRS --encryption-services blob
az storage account keys list --resource-group CLNPD1-ZCACN-RGP-CITZ-ICT-Cit01 --account-name tfstatecit
az storage container create --name tfstate --account-name tfstatecit --account-key $ACCOUNT_KEY
```

## Import Existing Resource Group

We have a specific resource group to use with this, so we need to import the instance into our terraform state.

`terraform import module.webapp.azurerm_resource_group.cit /subscriptions/be5c5c2b-d7e6-4940-ae15-37d7ef061283/resourceGroups/CLNPD1-ZCACN-RGP-CITZ-ICT-Cit01`
# How to Deploy to Azure

Once you have configured your Azure CLI and populated the `varaibles.auto.tfvars` file with your
Azure and Github credentials, you can perform the following steps to provision the infrastrcutre
necessary for deploying the app.

First, change into the `terraform` directory of this repository and then perform these commands.

1. `terraform init -backend-config="access_key=$ACCESS_KEY" -backend-config="resource_group_name=CLNPD1-ZCACN-RGP-CITZ-ICT-Cit01"`
2. Import existing resource group
`terraform import module.webapp.azurerm_resource_group.cit /subscriptions/be5c5c2b-d7e6-4940-ae15-37d7ef061283/resourceGroups/CLNPD1-ZCACN-RGP-CITZ-ICT-Cit01`
2. `terraform plan`
3. `terraform apply`

Once this has been completed, when you push a change to the 'main' branch it will automatically
build and push your frontend and backend images to the provisioned Azure Container Registry.

**NOTE**: You will need to manually enable continuous delivery on the AppServices through the Azure
portal in order to automatically deploy new changes (including initial deploy).

# How to delete all resources

Once you're finished, you may remove all resources provisioned with the following command.

`terraform destroy`

NOTE: This requires a maintained `.tfstate` file that was created in provisioning the resources in
the first place. Still looking at how to maintain this either via VCS or Terraform Cloud.
